  So 2020 happened. The start of the new 20s probably didn’t start as anyone expected. I said goodbye to the world of radiology, at least for now. Stayed inside more than I could expected, expanded some hobbies and helped build software for our frontline workers to name a few things. Let’s recap 2020.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
